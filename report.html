            <h2>New Horizons with Esri</h2>
            <p class='letter'>
                Since starting at Fleming, I have experienced something akin to vertigo as I have come to understand the vast possibility space afforded by Esri's applications and tools. From spatial analysis to environmental modeling, geometric correction to complex geoprocessing scripting, and the near limitless potential of ArcGIS Online/Server, I am consistently amazed at the range of options in the Esri-based analyst's toolset. My journey with Esri is ongoing, and my experiences have only continued to show me how much more there is to learn. Below I have outlined my experience and learnings with the software so far, and I look forward to continuing to explore each of these topics in even greater depth.
            </p>
            <h3>Spatial Modeling and Analysis</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                While at Fleming, I have become comfortable with a range of spatial analysis and modeling operations in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Desktop, working with both vector and raster data. I have performed both Boolean and weighted overlay analyses, including a site suitability report for drought-fighting "fog harvester" devices in California's struggling agricultural regions. I have explored a range of environmental modeling processes, including DEM creation with the Spatial Analyst extension's range of interpolation tools, and hydrological networks generation with both Spatial Analyst and ArcHydro toolsets. I have also employed topology, linear referencing, geocoding, and network and regression analysis tools with ArcGIS Pro, most notably as part of an ongoing project to explore the distribution of Community Recreation Centres in Toronto, Canada.            
            </p>
            <h3>Cartographic Work</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                Data without an effective medium will not tell a story, and so through our coursework I have strived to explore the power of Esri software in producing cartographic and data visualization outputs. Using ArcGIS Pro and Arc Map, I have produced both general purpose and thematic maps for web and print use. Leveraging the power of ArcGIS Pro's symbology and labelling functionality, I have created a range of maps depicting both qualitative and quantitative data, such as the urban zoning map of Nagoya, Japan included in my portfolio. I also have experience working with ArcGIS Scenes, applying custommade DEMs to create 3D surfaces and enhance display of imagery. Furthermore, through ArcGIS Online's Map Viewer, the ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, and the ArcGIS API for Javascript, I have created a number of stylized interactive web maps and applications, including an interactive tour of the Canadian provinces aimed at elementary school children.
            </p>
            <h3>Scripting and Geoprocessing</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                To strengthen my understanding of the inner workings of Esri software, I have worked to develop scripts that extend and automate the functionality of ArcGIS Pro's geoprocessing, feature creation, and symbolization functionality. I have created script tools that can be imported into ArcGIS Pro toolboxes to facilitate sharing and reusability. I have also developed standalone scripts designed to be run directly by the user and return text output based on geoprocessing operations, notably including a script that calculates the risks of wildfire, earthquake, and flooding for user supplied locations, to facilitate informed property purchases.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Management and Sharing</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                Additionally, I have used ArcGIS Pro to develop an understanding of best practices for the storage and sharing of GIS data, including deploying cohesive and effective file geodatabases that use domains, subtypes, attribute rules, and contingent values to enforce data integrity. I have also worked to build ETL workflows with FME to faciltate translation of data from disparate sources into geodatabase tables and feature classes. Taking data online, I have managed an ArcGIS Server running on an AWS EC2 instance, and am confident publishing data to, and pulling data from ArcGIS Server. Using Esri's REST Services and ArcGIS Online, I have prepared and shared spatial data for use in web applications and maps, and have created scripts with ArcGIS API for Javascript that effectively consume and display this data.
            </p>
            <p class='letter'>
                I am very much looking forward to taking all of these skills to the next level, both through the remainder of our program, and into my career beyond.
