            <h2>New Horizons with Esri</h2>
            <p class='letter'>
                Through the last six months of my time at Fleming, I have experienced something akin to vertigo as I came to understand the vast possibility space afforded by Esri's range of applications and tools. From spatial analysis to environmental modeling, geometric correction to complex geoprocessing scripting, and the near limitless potential of ArcGIS Online, I am consistently amazed at the range of options in the Esri-based analyst's toolset. My journey with Esri is ongoing, and my experiences have only continued to show me how much more there is to learn. Below I have outlined my experience and learnings with the software so far, and I look forward to continuing to explore each topic in even greater depth.
            </p>
            <h3>Spatial Modeling and Analysis</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                While at Fleming, I have become comfortable with a range of spatial analysis and modeling operations in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Desktop, working with both vector and raster data. I have performed both Boolean and weighted overlay analyses, including a site suitability report for drought-fighting "fog harvester" devices in California's struggling agricultural regions. I have practiced a range of environmental modeling workflows, including exploring DEM creation using the Spatial Analyst extension's interpolation tools, and creating hydrological networks with both Spatial Analyst and ArcHydro tools. I have also employed topology, linear referencing, geocoding, and network and regression analysis tools with ArcGIS Pro, most notably as part of an ongoing spatial analysis project to explore the distribution of Community Recreation Centres in Toronto, Canada.            
            </p>
            <h3>Cartographic Work</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                Data without an effective medium cannot tell a story, and so through our coursework I have had the opportunity to explore the power of Esri software in producing cartographic and data visualization outputs. Using ArcGIS Pro and Arc Map, I have produced both general purpose and thematic maps for web and print use. Leveraging the power of ArcGIS Pro's symbology and labelling functionality, I have produced a range of maps depicting both qualitative and quantitative data, such as the Land Use Map of Nagoya, Japan included in my portfolio. I also have experience working with ArcGIS Scenes, applying custom DEMs to create 3D surfaces and enhance display of imagery. Furthermore, through ArcGIS Online's Map Viewer, the ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, and the ArcGIS API for Javascript, I have created a number of stylized interactive web maps and applications, including an interactive tour of the Canadian provinces aimed at elementary school children.
            </p>
            <h3>Scripting and Geoprocessing</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                To deepen my understanding of the inner logic of Esri software, I have worked to develop scripts that extend and automate the functionality of ArcGIS Pro's geoprocessing, feature creation, and symbolization tools. I have created script tools that can be imported into ArcGIS Pro toolboxes to facilitate sharing and reusability. I have also developed standalone scripts designed to be run directly by the user and return text output based on geoprocessing operations, notably including a script that calculates the risks of wildfire, earthquake, and flooding for user supplied locations, to facilitate informed property purchases.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Management and Sharing</h3>         
            <p class='letter'>
                I have used ArcGIS Pro to develop an understanding of best practices for storage and sharing of GIS data, including deploying cohesive and effective file geodatabases that use domains, subtypes, attribute rules, and contingent values to enforce data integrity. I have also worked to build ETL workflows with FME to faciltate translation of data from disparate sources into geodatabase tables and feature classes. Taking GIS data online, I have managed an ArcGIS Server running on an AWS EC2 instance. Using Esri's REST Services and ArcGIS Online, I have prepared and shared spatial data for use in web applications and maps, and have created Javascript scripts with ArcGIS API for Javascript that effectively consume and display this data.
