                Dear GIS Faculty,
            </p>
        
            <p class='letter'>
                This website contains my formal application package for the Esri Canada GIS Scholarship. I am incredibly excited at the possibilities for continued learning included in the Scholarship, and hope that you will consider my application. I believe my academic achievements, community and class engagement, and written and verbal communication skills make me a strong candidate for the Scholarship.
            </p>
            <p class='letter'>
                Furthermore, I believe my communication and community facilitation skills position me well to represent the 2022 Fleming cohort. I feel that a culture of communication and knowledge sharing is the key to success in any field, and so have strived to help build that environment both in class and out. In September, I created a Discord server for students to gather, network, and discuss both academic and informal topics that has since become a hub for peer assistence and career advice. I strive to participate in discussions both in-class and within the Discord server, and try to assist with questions from other students whenever I can. As the Scholarship recipient, I would use these skills to effectively communicate the wide range of knowledge we have developed as Fleming GIS students, and the central place Esri software takes within our skillset.</p>

                Furthermore, my communication and community facilitation skills would position me well to represent the 2022 Fleming cohort and produce materials that effectively communicate the spirit of our program and the possibilities made available to students through the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application of Esri software taught within the program. I feel that communication and knowledge sharing is the key to success in any field, and so have strived to facilitate and participate in that effort, despite the inherent difficulties of a virtual learning environment. I created a Discord server for students to gather, network, and discuss both academic and informal topics. I strive to participate in discussions both in-class and within the Discord server, and try to assist with questions from other students whenever I can.
            </p>
            <p class="letter">
                Once again, I hope that you will consider me for this exciting opportunity, and am happy to answer any questions that may arise as you proceed through my application.
            </p>
            <p class="salutation">Yours Sincerely,</p>
