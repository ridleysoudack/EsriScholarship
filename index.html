                Dear GIS Faculty,
            </p>
        
            <p class='letter'>
                This website contains my formal application package for the Esri Canada GIS Scholarship. I am incredibly excited for this at the possibilities for continued learning offered through the Scholarship, and hope that you will consider me as the recipient. I believe my academic achievements, community and class engagement, and written and verbal communication skills make me a strong candidate for the scholarship.</p>
            <p class='letter'>
                Before Fleming, I had received no academic or professional exposure to GIS. When we began class back in September, I was nervous â€“ I was excited by the bigger picture of GIS work, but had heard about the rigours of the Fleming program, and had no idea whether I would be a good fit for the industry. To my continued delight, the field has proved immensely rewarding to explore and work within. I find myself relishing the problem solving involved in assignments in a way that I have not experienced academically in the past. I feel that my academic achievement reflects my excitement in this regard. I have maintained a 4.00 GPA with a 97.5% average across all completed courses, as I have strived to learn all I can across the range of specialties covered within our program. As part of this academic achievement, I have developed a strong working knowledge of the power and potential of Esri software for data management, analysis, and cartographic production. As the recipient of the scholarship, not only would I be afforded the opportunity to continue to build on these skills through software and learning material access, I also feel that I would be well positioned to effectively communicate my knowledge and enthusiasm for the field and tools available through my poster and report.
            </p>
            <p class="letter">Furthermore, my communication and community facilitation skills would position me well to represent the 2022 Fleming cohort and produce materials that effectively communicate the spirit of our program and the possibilities made available to students through the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application of Esri software taught within the program. I feel that communication and knowledge sharing is the key to success in any field, and so have strived to facilitate and participate in that effort, despite the inherent difficulties of a virtual learning environment. I created a Discord server for students to gather, network, and discuss both academic and informal topics. I strive to participate in discussions both in-class and within the Discord server, and try to assist with questions from other students whenever I can.</p>
            <p class="salutation-end">Yours Sincerely,</p>
